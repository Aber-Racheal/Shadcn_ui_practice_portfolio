                    Breaking the Myth: My Journey from Nutrition to Software Development <br/>
                    From the moment I could hold a spoon, I was encouraged to pursue a career that was secure, respected, and—most importantly—practical. So, when I decided to dive into nutrition, it seemed like the logical choice. I mean, food, health, science—what could go wrong? It was a well-respected field with tangible, life-changing impact. I spent years buried in textbooks, research papers, and food pyramids, and when I graduated with First Class Honours in Nutrition, I felt on top of the world. At that point, I thought I had it all figured out. My future was set in stone—until it wasn’t.

                    I mean, I could already picture it: that shiny white-collar NGO job with the perfect office overlooking a sprawling city, my million-dollar smile (okay, maybe just a few million shillings) on the paycheck, sipping on fancy coffee every morning as I made life-changing decisions that would change the health landscape forever... Right? Surely, that was the dream, right?

                    But somewhere, in the back of my mind, things started to feel a little... off. My heart, though content with nutrition, started to wander, asking questions I hadn’t thought to ask. “Is this really it?” It was like the universe dropped a question mark right next to my perfectly scripted life, and that question mark? It was technology.

                    Now, let me set the scene for you. I’m sitting on my university campus in Kampala, chatting with an old school friend, Yakub, who had come to visit me. He was studying software engineering at UICT in Nakawa, and his energy was contagious. We decided to hang out on one of my favorite spots—a metallic bench just outside the West Library. If you’ve ever sat on those benches, you know they’re not the comfiest. But that day, it didn’t matter because I was too engaged in the conversation to notice the discomfort.

                    Yakub spoke about his journey in tech with the kind of passion that only someone in love with coding could have. He talked about coding, problem-solving, and debugging (I didn’t even know what that was at the time) as though it was the most exciting thing in the world. I was mesmerized. But then, he shared something that hit me like a ton of bricks.

                    He told me about a female classmate of his who wouldn’t participate in group work because she thought tech was a field for men. A field for men?! That stung. I believe women can do anything—whether it's nutrition, tech, or even running a tech startup while making amazing smoothies on the side. I couldn’t let this myth go unchallenged. And that's when it hit me: I wanted in on tech.

                    That conversation with Yakub was the spark that ignited a whole new passion inside me. The next day, I made the decision: I was going to pivot my career and dive into software development. It wasn’t going to be easy, but if there was one thing I learned from my nutrition studies, it was the power of persistence.

                    So, I did what any rational person would do after a conversation like that: I enrolled in a Diploma in Information Technology at a women-focused campus in Nairobi, Kenya. Oh, and did I mention? I got a scholarship! It was like the universe was saying, “Yep, you’re on the right track, now go chase it!” I remember sitting there, looking at my scholarship letter and thinking, "All things are working together for me!" It felt like everything I had worked for up to that point had led me to this very moment.

                    And just when I thought the journey was about to get predictable, enter Nehemiah—a quiet, reserved church colleague who, at first glance, seemed like he was more about deep conversations than coding. But as we started talking more, I discovered that Nehemiah was a software engineer. Yep, just casually solving tech problems and making magic happen behind the scenes. I remember thinking, "Okay, this is a sign." Just when I was waiting to hear back about my application to the Nairobi tech institute, Nehemiah appeared like the tech guardian angel I didn’t know I needed.

                    The timing was uncanny. Nehemiah and Yakub were the two pillars that helped support my transition into tech. They weren’t just tech mentors; they were life mentors. They taught me not only how to solve problems in coding but also how to approach life with patience, critical thinking, and creativity. Nehemiah, in particular, had this way of making complex concepts seem simple. It was like watching someone turn a Rubik's Cube into a child’s toy. He didn’t just teach me how to code; he taught me how to think like a developer—methodically, but with plenty of creative flair.

                    And then there was Yakub. Whenever my coding projects felt like they were hitting a wall, whenever Stack Overflow was no help, and Reddit just made me more confused, I knew I could count on Yakub. He was my go-to when I needed guidance, encouragement, or just a good laugh about how messy the tech world can be. Whether it was through coding challenges or late-night debugging sessions, Yakub and Nehemiah became my tech support system, my constant backup when the code wouldn’t compile and the solution felt like it was on another planet.

                    Fast forward to today, and I’m a proud software developer, navigating the tech world with more confidence than I ever imagined. I look back at my journey from a First Class Honours Nutrition graduate to a tech enthusiast, and I can’t help but laugh at how far I’ve come. It’s been a wild ride, full of learning curves, late-night coding sessions, and plenty of “debugging” moments (in my code and in my life). But I’ve never looked back. I’m living proof that it’s never too late to pivot.

                    I’m also deeply grateful for Yakub and Nehemiah. These two are not just my friends; they’re my mentors and support system. They’ve made the journey so much easier, sharing their knowledge, cracking jokes when things get too tense, and showing me that the best part of being in tech is the people you meet along the way.

                    And I’m just getting started. I’m driven by the belief that African women can—and should—be part of the tech revolution. Coding isn’t just for men. It’s for anyone willing to learn, innovate, and break through barriers.

                    So, if you're reading this and you think tech isn't for you, or you feel like you're too late to start—think again. My journey is far from over, and I can’t wait to see where this path takes me.

                    And to Yakub and Nehemiah: Thanks for being the real MVPs. You’ve been my backup when the stack overflows, my mentors when I hit dead ends, and my friends who have believed in me even when I doubted myself. I wouldn’t be here without you.
