                    <span className="text-[90px]">F</span>rom the moment I could hold a spoon, I was encouraged to pursue a
                    career that was secure, respected, and—most importantly—practical. So,
                    when I decided to dive into nutrition, it seemed like the logical
                    choice. I mean, food, health, science—what could go wrong? It was a
                    well-respected field with tangible, life-changing impact. I spent years
                    buried in textbooks, research papers, and food pyramids, and when I
                    graduated with First Class Honours in Nutrition, I felt on top of the
                    world. At that point, I thought I had it all figured out. My future was
                    set in stone—until it wasn’t.

                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    I mean, I could already picture it: that shiny white-collar NGO job
                    with the perfect office overlooking a sprawling city, my million-dollar
                    smile (okay, maybe just a few million shillings) on the paycheck, sipping
                    on fancy coffee every morning as I made life-changing decisions that
                    would change the health landscape forever... Right? Surely, that was the
                    dream, right?
                </p>

                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    But somewhere, in the back of my mind, things started to feel a little...
                    off. My heart, though content with nutrition, started to wander, asking
                    questions I hadn’t thought to ask. “Is this really it?” It was like the
                    universe dropped a question mark right next to my perfectly scripted
                    life, and that question mark? It was technology.
                </p>

                {/* Fourth Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    Now, let me set the scene for you. I’m sitting on my university campus
                    in Kampala, chatting with an old school friend, Yakub, who had come to
                    visit me. He was studying software engineering at UICT in Nakawa, and
                    his energy was contagious. We decided to hang out on one of my favorite
                    spots—a metallic bench just outside the West Library. If you’ve ever
                    sat on those benches, you know they’re not the comfiest. But that day,
                    it didn’t matter because I was too engaged in the conversation to notice
                    the discomfort.
                </p>

                {/* Fifth Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    Yakub spoke about his journey in tech with the kind of passion that only
                    someone in love with coding could have. He talked about coding,
                    problem-solving, and debugging (I didn’t even know what that was at the
                    time) as though it was the most exciting thing in the world. I was
                    mesmerized. But then, he shared something that hit me like a ton of
                    bricks.
                </p>

                {/* Sixth Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    He told me about a female classmate of his who wouldn’t participate in
                    group work because she thought tech was a field for men. A field for
                    men?! That stung. I believe women can do anything—whether it's
                    nutrition, tech, or even running a tech startup while making amazing
                    smoothies on the side. I couldn’t let this myth go unchallenged. And
                    that's when it hit me: I wanted in on tech.
                </p>

                {/* Seventh Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    That conversation with Yakub was the spark that ignited a whole new
                    passion inside me. The next day, I made the decision: I was going to
                    pivot my career and dive into software development. It wasn’t going to
                    be easy, but if there was one thing I learned from my nutrition studies,
                    it was the power of persistence.
                </p>

                {/* Eighth Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    So, I did what any rational person would do after a conversation like
                    that: I enrolled in a Diploma in Information Technology at a
                    women-focused campus in Nairobi, Kenya. Oh, and did I mention? I got a
                    scholarship! It was like the universe was saying, “Yep, you’re on the
                    right track, now go chase it!” I remember sitting there, looking at my
                    scholarship letter and thinking, "All things are working together for
                    me!" It felt like everything I had worked for up to that point had led
                    me to this very moment.
                </p>

                {/* Ninth Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    And just when I thought the journey was about to get predictable, enter
                    Nehemiah—a quiet, reserved church colleague who, at first glance, seemed
                    like he was more about deep conversations than coding. But as we started
                    talking more, I discovered that Nehemiah was a software engineer. Yep,
                    just casually solving tech problems and making magic happen behind the
                    scenes. I remember thinking, "Okay, this is a sign." Just when I was
                    waiting to hear back about my application to the Nairobi tech institute,
                    Nehemiah appeared like the tech guardian angel I didn’t know I needed.
                </p>

                {/* Closing Section */}
                <p className="text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed tracking-wide space-y-6 animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__delay-1s text-justify mb-8">
                    Fast forward to today, and I’m a proud software developer, navigating
                    the tech world with more confidence than I ever imagined. I look back at
                    my journey from a First Class Honours Nutrition graduate to a tech
                    enthusiast, and I can’t help but laugh at how far I’ve come. It’s been a
                    wild ride, full of learning curves, late-night coding sessions, and
                    plenty of “debugging” moments (in my code and in my life). But I’ve
                    never looked back. I’m living proof that it’s never too late to pivot.
